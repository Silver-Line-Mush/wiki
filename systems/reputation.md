# Reputation System
In **The city** Your reputation can make or break you.  It's a currency all on its own, leaned on for power and influence - staked for risky moves, and potentially burned. This is a system made to represent a character's personal influence on the city. **Every month, gain your mind in Reputation tokens to spend on new base moves**.

## New Base Move: Swagger
In **The city**, your reputation, your confidence - your swagger can make or break you.  It can earn you bounty, or defeat.  This move is a representation of using your reputation and confidence to get your hands on the material things that the average person can't.  When a character uses their swagger it's a big deal meant to stake their personal reputation and even life to get what they want.

### Mechanics
Spend your reputation on temporary items with significant story impact. Items in PBtA are measured by the tags that they contain.

- **A positive** tag costs one token.  *Ex.*  Area, Silver, Valuable, Range, Melee, etc.
- **A negative** tag refunds a point (down to 1) *Ex.* Messy, Loud, Fragile, etc.
- **Armor and harm tags are capped at 3.**
- Some playbooks have specialized effects they can add to items.  These tags normally require a note that reads in the following format: *Because this Item is  [describe the effect, addition or enchantment], I get [bonus] when I [describe conditions] when [describe a narrow circumstance]*.
- At the end of the month, the item disappears, and the character's reputation tokens are reset to their base value.  If a single advancement is spent on the item, it becomes a permanent part of the character's personal story.
